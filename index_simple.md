An information architect ensures that your information is <mark>organised</mark> and <mark>presented</mark> in ways that <mark>make sense to the audience</mark>.

When information is designed for the audience:

1. Employees and customers learn more quickly
2. Less time is wasted in looking for and interpreting the information
3. People make fewer mistakes
4. You will attract more customers

### How does information architecture work?

Information architecture brings together three elements:

- <b>People</b> - the audience for the information and those who will be processing it
- <b>Processes</b> - ensuring information is collected, processed and presented as efficiently as possible, with the appropriate controls in place
- <b>Technology</b> - finding the right tools and systems for a particular context

The aim is to ensure that accurate, up-to-date information is available and findable when people need it, with minimal barriers in place to using and understanding that information.
