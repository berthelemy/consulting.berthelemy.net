An information architect ensures that your information is <mark>organised</mark> and <mark>presented</mark> in ways that make sense <b>to the audience</b>.

When information is designed for the audience:

1. They will want to use it
2. They will gain value from it
3. It will have the impact you expect

I can help you:

- **Structure and write your documents** such as requests for proposals, reports, technical manuals, standard operating procedures and policies
- **Rationalise and rework your internal documentation systems**, such as Sharepoint, Confluence, Gitbook, Notion and Xwiki
- **Design and build courses** in Moodle, TalentLMS, Learndash and others
- **Identify and present your key messages** on your website, in slide decks and through data-driven reports
