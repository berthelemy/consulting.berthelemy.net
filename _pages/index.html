<p>With over 30 years experience at the cutting edge of learning technology, I help organisations through critical inflexion points - as they scale, add new products, change direction, or bring in new ways of working.</p>

<p>I bridge the communication gap between learning specialists, business leaders and IT in companies and not-for-profits.</p>
