## Hayley Barnard - CEO Mix Diversity

Mark supported Mix Diversity to develop and take to market a brand new diversity and inclusion learning solution called MixLEARN. This included helping scope out our technical requirements, develop the tender document, oversee the whole tender process including interviewing potential software providers, through to selection. With his help we found the two solutions we needed to be able to build out our highly specialist learning product. Mark developed a project plan to keep us on track and ensured we hit our deadline to launch at Learning Technologies Exhibition in May 2023, to huge success. He trained our people internally and was a reassuring presence throughout the entire project. No challenge was too great. 

Mark is a hugely experienced, knowledgeable and well connected professional in the learning technology space. He is also a highly decent human being and fun to work with. We have already recommended him to other companies and know we will likely call on him again when the need arises.

Mark, thank you for helping my dream come true of developing a learning platform and library that enables the advancement of diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. We're proud to have developed something that goes beyond the bog standard that is already in the market place and couldn't have done it without you.
