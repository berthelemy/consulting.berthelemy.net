<p>I am an experienced learning leader, technology consultant, project manager, digital product owner, solution architect, communicator, <a href="https://faouetinformatique.net" target="_blank">website designer</a>, <a href="https://musique.berthelemy.net" target="_blank">musician</a> and <a href="https://nestledinbrittany.org.uk/" target="_blank">aspiring travel writer</a>.</p>

<p>With over 30 years within education, learning & development and technology, I've got a huge amount of experience and knowledge to offer to my clients.</p>

<p>I'm an advocate of open-source solutions, like Moodle, where appropriate, but will happily use proprietary software when that would be the better answer.</p>

<p>I was an early adopter of Moodle, and have used it pretty much continuously for the past 20 years. It's extensible architecture makes it a good answer for many (but not all) learning and assessment delivery problems.</p>

<p>I'm fully registered and insured in France, and work with clients across the English-speaking world.</p>
