<p>I am an experienced technology consultant, project manager, digital product owner, solution architect, communicator, <a href="https://faouetinformatique.net" target="_blank">website designer</a>, <a href="https://musique.berthelemy.net" target="_blank">musician</a> and <a href="https://nestledinbrittany.org.uk/" target="_blank">aspiring travel writer</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I help <strong>vendors</strong> to navigate the learning technology market, design new products, and act as a solutions consultant and implementation manager.</li>
  <li>I help their <strong>buyers</strong> get the best out of existing technologies, design solutions, find new suppliers where necessary, and manage projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst I am confident in working with the full range of learning technology and knowledge management software platforms, I am a particular expert in the open-source platform, <a href="https://moodle.org" target="_blank">Moodle</a>.</p>

<p>I have been involved with Moodle since its very early days, and implemented it in many organisations. The most recent being the CABI Academy - taking it from a standing start to supporting more than 28,000 learners worldwide.</p>

<p>Mark Berthelemy Consulting is based in France, and works with clients across the English-speaking world.</p>
