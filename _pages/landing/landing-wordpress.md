Wordpress is one of the most popular tools on the planet for creating websites.

The software is free to download (from <a href="https://wordpress.org" target="_blank">wordpress.org</a>, which is a good start. It's well-designed, and reasonably straightforward to use.

### The quick and easy route

You could start off by creating a free account on <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress.com</a>.

This would give you a basic site, with a Wordpress web address, on a system shared by many thousands of people.

If you want to personalise your wordpress.com site a bit more, or do more than the free account offers, then you'll might want to go to a paid account.

That gives you a lot more scope, within the limits set by wordpress.com.

You may also need someone to help you set things up so that your site is findable, attractive, usable and accessible.

### A step up

If you need something outside of what wordpress.com can offer, then you'll probably want to have your own copy of Wordpress, under your control.

That will require some effort:

- **Choose your hosting provider** - There are dozens of companies who will host Wordpress for you. Some focus on price, others on scalability, and others on security. I can help find a supplier that will meet your specific needs.
- **Choose your domain name** - Your "domain" is the name you'll be known by on the web. It's important to get this right, and to register it via a company that gives you full control over its use (not all do). I can help you choose your name,  organise its purchase, and set it up to point to your website and email system.
- **Plan your site** - What types of information do you want to store and display? How can we help users to find it? What do you want users to do when they're there? I can help you work through these decisions.
- **Design the look and feel** - If you don't yet have a logo, colors or typography, I can recommend some designers that I like to work with. Once you have those in place, then we can explore how to use them on your new site.
- **Configure the system** - Wordpress has hundreds of configurable options, and plugins that can massively increase the capability and security of the system. I can take away the pain of making choices that will stand the test of time.
- **Build the site** - this is an iterative process of adding content, functionality and design elements to make a site that is findable, attractive, usable and accessible. I can do all or some of this for you - depending on your capabilities.
- **Monitoring and support** - Things go wrong with all websites - whether by accident or deliberate attack. You'll want to know quickly when something has happened, and that there is someone there to help. I can keep an eye on the site and liaise with the hosting and software providers to get you up and running as quickly as possible.
- **Capability building** - If you want to become self-sufficient with your website, you'll probably require a lot of coaching and support to ensure you keep it working at its best. I can take you to the point where you're ready to run on your own.
