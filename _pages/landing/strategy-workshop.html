<p>Organisations regularly reach inflexion points where they need to make decisions about their future direction.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do we start this new project?</li>
  <li>Do we enter a new market?</li>
  <li>Do we launch a new product?</li>
  <li>Do we expand?</li>
  <li>Do we contract?</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, it can be helpful to bring in someone to provide guidance on that direction.</p>

<p>That's where I can help.</p>

<p>With over 30 years in corporate learning & development and not-for-profit education programmes, I bring a wide range of expertise and experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning solution leadership</li>
  <li>Technology selection and implementation</li>
  <li>Product management</li>
  <li>Team leadership</li>
</ul>

<p>Book me for a strategy workshop with your key stakeholders to help explore your options.</p>

<h2>Strategy workshop plan</h2>


 <h3>Preparation</h3>
      
        <p>Please be prepared to answer the questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where are you currently at, as an organisation?</li>
          <li>Where do you want to be?</li>
          <li>What is driving the change?</li>
          <li>What have you tried already?</li>
          <li>What has worked?</li>
          <li>What hasn't worked? Why?</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>Timing: Before the workshop</p>
   <h3>Workshop</h3>
      
        <p>An online<sup>*</sup>, interactive workshop with up to seven people.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Introductions & welcome</li>
          <li>Your current state</li>
          <li>Your inflexion point</li>
          <li>Your future state</li>
        </ol>
      <p>Timing: 3 hours</p>
    <h3>Report</h3>
    
      <p>I will provide a report of our discussions, along with my proposals for how you should proceed.</p>
    
    <p>Timing: Within 3 working days of the workshop</p>


<p><sup>*</sup> I can travel if required. I tend to work online in order to reduce costs for my clients and to maximise my time.</p>

<h2>Return on Investment</h2>

<p>Without input from an expert, you will probably spend several weeks investigating options, understanding the language being used, and identifying the advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>I can help you shortcut that process, thus saving you several thousand euros or pounds!</p>
