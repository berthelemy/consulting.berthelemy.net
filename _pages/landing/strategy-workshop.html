<p>Organisations regularly reach inflexion points where they need to make decisions about their future direction.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do we start this new project?</li>
  <li>Do we enter a new market?</li>
  <li>Do we launch a new product?</li>
  <li>Do we expand?</li>
  <li>Do we contract?</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, it can be helpful to bring in someone to provide guidance on that direction.</p>

<p>That's where I can help.</p>

<p>With over 30 years in corporate learning & development and not-for-profit education programmes, I bring a wide range of expertise and experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning solution leadership</li>
  <li>Technology selection and implementation</li>
  <li>Product management</li>
  <li>Team leadership</li>
</ul>

<p>Book me for a strategy workshop with your key stakeholders to help explore your options.</p>

          <li>What is driving the change?</li>
          <li>What have you tried already?</li>
          <li>What has worked?</li>
          <li>What hasn't worked? Why?</li>
        </ul>
