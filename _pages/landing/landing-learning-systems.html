<p>Hundreds of companies offer software designed to support teaching and learning in some way or other.</p>

<p>Yet there are some that stand out for offering flexible and highly capable systems - able to work well in a variety of situations.</p>

<p>For many contexts, I recommend organisations look at <a href="https://moodle.org" target="_blank">Moodle</a> and <a href="https://www.learndash.com/" target="_blank">Learndash</a> (based on the popular <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> content management system). Combine either of these with the <a href="https://h5p.org/" target="_blank">H5P</a> interactive content tool, and the <a href="https://www.arlo.co/" target="_blank">Arlo Training Management software</a> and you will have an extremely powerful system.</p>

<p>For certain, neither Moodle nor Learndash will always be the right answer. There are a multitude of alternatives, for all sizes of organisation, and even for specific industries.</p>

<h3>Starter questions</h3>

<p>Whenever I'm helping people find the right system, I tend to first ask these five questions. The answers to them will help to quickly narrow down the choice.</p>

<h4>What is the business problem you want to solve?</h4>
<p>How will you know you've succeeded? What measures will you use?</p>

<h4>Who are you providing a service for?</h4>
<p>Is it just people in your organisation? If so, do they need to be organised in a certain way to match your organisation structure?</p>
<p>Is it your organisation's customers? If so, are they all individuals, or are your customers also organisations themselves?</p>

<h4>How many people will use the system?</h4>
<p>Will you be starting small and scaling gradually? Will you need to be able to handle sudden peaks in usage?</p>
<p>Do you have a budget that can handle a per user license fee? How will you be financing the ongoing usage of the system?</p>

<h4>How will people get to your courses/resources?</h4>
<p>What is your ideal process? Will it be self-service? Do you need card payments? Will there be some form of automation based on what you know about the people?</p>
<p>Will you need some form of single-sign on based on your organisation's or your customers' systems?</p>

<h4>What types of learning experience do you want to provide?</h4>
<p>Fully online? Mixed with face-to-face? Self-study? Instructor-led? Rigorous assessments? Portfolios of evidence? Branching scenarios? Searchable resources?</p>

<h3>How can I help?</h3>

<p>Just as with my <a href="https://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress services</a>, I can help you navigate the technology landscape to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the right provider</li>
  <li>Manage the implementation project</li>
  <li>Liaise with the supplier(s)</li>
</ol>

<p>Organisations across Europe have relied on me to be a trusted, independent specialist - able to translate their business requirements into terms the vendors will understand, and vice versa.</p>
