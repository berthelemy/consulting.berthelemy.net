<h2 id="1">Supplier selection</h2>
    <p>Finding the right supplier is about connecting multiple dots, such as business requirements, culture, technology, legal and user experience.</p>
    <p>I can help you:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Review your current learning technology landscape, and work with you to develop a roadmap for the future</li>
    <li>Prepare business cases for non-technical decision makers</li>
    <li>Create requests for proposals that maximise the chance of finding the right supplier</li>
    <li>Design solutions to ensure your people get the best value from your current and future technology</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="2">System implementation</h2>
    <p>Your learning technology implementation projects depend on someone who can liaise between multiple technical and non-technical stakeholders.</p>
    <p>I can help you:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Develop realistic plans and manage them through</li>
    <li>Hold your suppliers to account</li>
    <li>Communicate with senior stakeholders</li>

  <h2 id="3">Information architecture</h2>
    <p>Poorly organised information is difficult to find, navigate and understand. When people can find, navigate and understand your information, they are much more likely to buy from you, or to work in the way you need them to work.</p>
    <p>I can help you:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Review your current information architectures - on your website or internal systems</li>
    <li>Design new architectures to meet your current and future needs</li>
    <li>Get the best from your existing information systems</li>
    <li>Find and implement new information systems</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="4">Learning design leadership</h2>
    <p>Learning design is about more than just using appropriate technology. It's about performance consulting, solution design, relationships with subject matter experts, effective writing, graphic design and media asset creation. </p>
    <p>I can help you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop a consultancy-led approach</li>
      <li>Set standards</li>
      <li>Devise repeatable processes</li>
      <li>Coach and train your team</li>
    </ul>
