            <p>For more than 20 years I've operated as a consultant - bringing specialist knowledge to organisations and teams.</p>

            <p>If you're new to consulting, whether internal to your organisation, or as a freelancer, there's a lot to learn. Depending on your type of setup, you may need skills in:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Generic consulting (like listening, questioning, networking and communication)</li>
            <li>Project and programme management</li>
            <li>Business and data analysis</li>
            <li>Business management and finance</li>
            <li>Sales and marketing</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Building on my background in teaching and adult learning, I am now able to offer a coaching programme for people at the beginning of their consulting journeys.</p>

            <p>The programme will help you to identify and develop the skills you need.</p>

            <h3>Refund and cancellation policy</h3>

            <p>Your purchase of coaching packages or sessions indicates your commitment to participate in the process and follow through to its conclusion. However, I also understand that unexpected events can happen. In addition to the general guidelines outlined below, refunds and cancellations will be considered on an individual basis, at my discretion.</p>

            <p>In general these guidelines apply for coaching refunds and cancellations:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The Client may cancel an order within 24 hours of purchasing and request a refund. The refund will be issued, minus a 5% transaction fee. To cancel an order, send your request to <a href="mailto:mark@berthelemy.net">mark@berthelemy.net</a>.</li>
                <li>Once I have scheduled sessions with the Client, they are considered set appointments. However, if necessary, the Client may request to reschedule a session, if they give at least 24 hours advance notice.</li>
                <li>Any missed sessions or cancelled sessions with less than 24 hours advance notice will be forfeited. </li>
                <li>If unexpected circumstances prevent the Client from completing all of their scheduled sessions, then the Client may request a refund for the amount pertaining to the remaining sessions. If approved, the refund will be issued, minus a 5% transaction fee.</li>
            </ul>
