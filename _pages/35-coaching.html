<p>If you're new to consulting, whether internal to your organisation, or as an external specialist, there's a lot to learn. Depending on your type of setup, you may need skills in:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Business analysis</li>
    <li>Business and financial management</li>
    <li>Communication</li>
    <li>Data analysis</li>
    <li>Networking</li>
    <li>Project and programme management</li>
    <li>Sales and marketing</li>
    <li>Choosing and using consultancy tools</li>
</ul>

<p>For more than 20 years I've operated as a consultant - bringing specialist knowledge to organisations and teams.</p>
<p>Building on my background in teaching and adult learning, I am now able to offer a coaching programme for people at the beginning of their consulting journeys.</p>

<p>The programme will help you to identify and develop the skills you need.</p>
