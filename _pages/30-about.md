### Brief history

Having spent 11 years in a mixture of teaching and church support roles, I found my niche at Capita, where I developed my skills as a learning technology solutions architect. This allowed me to grow in all sorts of directions - developing sales propositions, managing online communities, building websites, running projects, designing systems, and working closely with technology suppliers.

Twelve years later, in 2012, I was ready to spread my wings and jump full-time into running an independent consulting business - helping all sorts of organisations find, design and use appropriate technologies to meet their training, education and communication needs.

Now I'm living in France, still doing similar things, but as a French "auto-entrepreneur" - the approximate equivalent to the UK's "self-employed". My clients are mostly English-speaking, either in the Euro zone, or in the UK.

For longer or larger projects, I put the contracts through [Challenge & Co](https://www.freelanceinfrance.com/), a "portage salarial", who manage the invoicing and payroll.
