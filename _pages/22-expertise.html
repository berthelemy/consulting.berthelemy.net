    <li>Managing the project to deliver the solution</li>
    <li>Creating data-driven websites to deliver communications and data dashboards</li>
</ul>

        <p>The market for learning & development software is wide, varied and complex. There are many acronyms, technical specifications, standards and conventions.</p>
