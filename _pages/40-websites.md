## Fast, secure, mobile and user-friendly

My aim is always to build websites that are:

- **Fast**: They load quickly on both large and small screen devices
- **Secure**: They use the most up-to-date technology to reduce the risk of hacking
- **Mobile**: They will work well on a small-screen device
- **User-friendly**: They're designed around the needs of both the user, and you, the owner

## Tools used

I build websites using a suite of tools, depending on what is required.

For small sites, where I manage all the content, I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and host on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

For medium to large sizes, where a non-technical owner wants to be able to make changes to text and images, I use [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) and host on the French hosting service [Host-Stage.net](https://www.host-stage.net/) or the UK service [Kualo](https://www.kualo.com/webhosting) - although I'm happy to look at your own provider if you prefer.

I *can* build websites using [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org). It will do pretty much anything you throw at it, but can end up becoming a bit of a beast that is then difficult to maintain and keep secure. If you do use Wordpress, I recommend hosting on [34sp.com](https://www.34sp.com/)
