For more than 20 years I've operated as a consultant - bringing specialist knowledge to organisations and teams.

If you are new to consulting, whether internal to your organisation, or as a freelancer, there's a lot to learn. Depending on your type of setup, you may need skills in:

- Generic consulting (like listening, questioning, networking and communication)
- Project and programme management
- Business and data analysis
- Business management and finance
- Sales and marketing

Building on my background in teaching and adult learning, I am now able to offer a coaching programme for people at the beginning of their consulting journeys.

The programme will help you to identify and develop the skills you need.

[Book a free call with me](https://cal.com/markberthelemy) now to explore whether it will work for you. 

### How it works
