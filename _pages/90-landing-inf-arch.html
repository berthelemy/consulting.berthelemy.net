<p>Do you want your customers and your staff to find relevant information quickly?</p>

<p>Whether on a website or an internal information system, how you organise and present your information is critical.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6 col-12-small">
    <p>Poorly organised information is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Difficult to find</li>
      <li>Difficult to navigate</li>
      <li>Difficult to understand</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-6 col-12-small">
    <p>Well-organised information is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to find</li>
      <li>Easy to navigate</li>
      <li>Easy to understand</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When people can find, navigate and understand your information, they are much more likely to buy from you, or to work in the way you need them to work.</p>

<h3>About information architecture</h3>

<p>Information architecture is the way that information is organized and labelled in a system. It is about making information easy to find, understand, and use.</p>

<p>For example, the information architecture of a website would include the way that the pages are organized, the labels that are used for the different sections, and the navigation system that allows users to find what they are looking for.</p>

<p></p>Good information architecture is essential for a good user experience. When information is well-organized, users can find what they need quickly and easily. This can lead to increased satisfaction and productivity.</p>

<p>Good information architecture</p>
<ul>
  <li>Organizes the information in a logical way</li>
  <li>Uses clear and concise labels</li>
  <li>Creates a consistent navigation system</li>
  <li>Tests the information architecture with users</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine you are in a library. The books are all arranged in a certain way, and there is a system for finding the books you need. This system is the information architecture of the library. It helps you to find the books you need quickly and easily.</p>

<p>In the same way, information architecture helps users to find the information they need in a system. Whether it's a website, a software application, or a physical space, good information architecture can make it easier for users to get what they need.</p>
