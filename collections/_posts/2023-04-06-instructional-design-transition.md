The links below are jumping-off points designed for someone who is transitioning to an instructional or learning design role. Most of them are **resources** rather than **courses**, simply because that's the route I tend to take myself. Courses are great if you need the structure to force you to practice. My learning is typically a little bit more ad hoc, happening at the point of need, and based on an extreme curiosity about how things work.
