The Government Digital Service is a mine of useful information and advice on how to get the best out of teams.

One of my favourites is the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/" target="_blank">poster they have displayed in their offices</a> which describes really clearly their work culture.

We've prettified the poster and made it available here for anyone to use.
