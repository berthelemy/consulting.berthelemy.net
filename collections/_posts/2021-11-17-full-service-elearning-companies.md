I was asked recently which companies I would recommend to offer a "full" elearning service. By "full", I mean offering the whole works:

- Solution design / Consultancy
- Bespoke content design
- Delivery platform
- Implementation services

I'm focussing on UK-based companies for now. Even then, there are dozens, if not hundreds to choose from.

So, to narrow things down, I'll go for the ones that have been around for a while, have a solid track record, and big enough to work with large organisations.

Apologies to anyone I miss out. This is a list based on companies or people that I know personally. It's not meant to be comprehensive. It's the list I would start with if I was looking for such services.

Inclusion in the list isn't a recommendation. Each company has its particular strengths. It's a matter of finding the one that is the right fit for your needs and your culture. (Although don't be afraid to try the ones that will challenge you - they might actually be the most effective.)
