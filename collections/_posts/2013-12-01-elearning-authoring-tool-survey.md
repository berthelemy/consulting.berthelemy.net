Over the past few years a number of tools designed to help people author elearning materials have come to the market.

The main ones in use seem to be Articulate, Articulate Storyline and Captivate &#8211; although there are plenty of others also designed, like these, for individual learning designers. Some are software applications that you download, others are browser-based.

There are also some really high-end tools that have features like team workflows, version control, reuse of content chunks, collaborative authoring and single-source publishing.

I've been looking at the <a title="Xerte Community website" href="http://www.xerte.org.uk/" target="_blank">Xerte project</a> for quite a while, and promoting it to my clients. It&#8217;s an open-source server-based authoring tool &#8211; used in over 100 universities and other organisations worldwide. I'm really impressed with its capabilities and would recommend you give it a try (being open-source there&#8217;s no cost involved apart from a bit of time and effort).

I'm thinking about investing time and resources into Xerte to make it an even better system, but would first like to get a feel for what you need from a tool like this.

I've created a simple survey that&#8217;s designed to help me understand your priorities for an elearning authoring tool. I'll happily share the results &#8211; just leave your email address.
