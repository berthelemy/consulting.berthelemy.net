It was probably about 2004-5 when I first came in touch with Jay Cross and his work. I was moving from education into workplace learning, and his ideas about informal learning struck a chord with me.

The thing about his writing was not so much that it was new and ground-breaking, but more that it set out clearly and succintly things that just made sense.

There have been many times when I&rsquo;ve pointed people towards his simple diagram comparing investment in learning interventions with the amount of learning that actually takes place. And even more times when I described the difference between informal and formal learning using his graph (shown below).

Jay was always gracious and generous when asked for permission to use his work. Although I never had the opportunity to discuss ideas with him, his character shone through in his writing and his videos.

As a community of learning professionals I have lost one of my leaders - who wasn&rsquo;t afraid to set a direction and go all out for it.

RIP Jay. We&rsquo;ll miss you.
