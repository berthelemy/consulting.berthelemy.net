As part of my work on Lean Learning, I've also been looking at the whole concept of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking" target="_blank">systems thinking</a>&#8221; &#8211; where, rather than focussing on a specific component, you look at how the component fits within the wider system.

The TED talk below is a fantastic introduction to systems thinking and what can be achieved when you visualise your system. It&#8217;s an approach I are looking to use in my [lean thinking workshops][1].
