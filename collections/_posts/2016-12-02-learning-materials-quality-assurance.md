We were asked recently to provide an independent quality assurance service for one of our clients.

The materials in question were a series of elearning packages and associated files and assessments.

So, what should you be looking for when aiming for a high quality product?

#### The learner journey

Note that a QA check like this is no substitute for a full usability test with real users.

##### User experience

How the user is taken through the activities and resources, identifying any pain points from the userâ€™s perspective. Consider how the learner will get to the materials - the whole journey from initial contact through to completion.

##### User interface

Whether the interface itself is a barrier to users.

##### Learning efficacy

How the activities and resources work together to ensure learning objectives are best supported. Will learners be frustrated because it's too hard, or bored because it's too easy?

##### Engagement

The motivating factors that will retain the user's attention during the learning module.

#### Accessibility

Note that a QA check like this should be complemented by a full accessibility audit with an organisation like the <a href="http://webacc.shaw-trust.org.uk/our-services/website-accessibility-auditing/" target="_blank">Shaw Trust</a>

##### Browser control

What happens when the user resizes text and switches of images &amp; CSS?

##### Cognition

Consider headings, link purpose, consistency and readability. Use a tool such as <a href="https://readability-score.com/text/" target="_blank">Readability Score</a>

##### Visual impairments

Consider aspects such as availability to screen readers, [alt] text descriptions, use of colour and colour contrast, and page semantic structure

##### Hearing impairements

Consider aspects such as Closed Captions and visual alternatives

##### Motor impairements

Consider aspects such as tabbing through the interface and keyboard control

#### Technical design

##### SCORM

Consider any metadata requirements, content packaging conformance and use of optional runtime elements (especially if these packages need to be portable between systems)

##### Page size

Consider the bandwidth needed for each page

##### Devices

Consider which devices, screen sizes and resolutions. Should the packages support Retina displays. Should the pages be responsive? If so, to what sizes?

##### Browser compatibility

Which browser versions should the packages be tested against?

##### Reusability

Consider how the packages might be localised if necessary. Will they need to be editable by someone else? If so, do they have the software required to do so?

##### Security

If assessments are built into the packages, how will the answers be kept secure? If using xAPI, how will the communication between the packages and the LRS be secured appropriately?
