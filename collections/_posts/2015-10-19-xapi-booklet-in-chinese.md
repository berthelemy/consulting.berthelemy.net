Last year, I published a short, introductory booklet <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MarkBerthelemy/exploring-the-potential-of-the-xapi-aka-tin-can-api" target="_blank">&ldquo;Exploring the potential of xAPI&rdquo;</a>, designed for a non-technical audience.

I placed it on Slideshare, and gave it out at my xAPI workshops, where I received some very good reviews.

Recently, I was asked to do a webinar on the topic for a group of Chinese learning technologists. As a follow-up, Jessie Chuang, from <a href="http://classroom-aid.com/" target="_blank">Classroom Aid</a> (who helped organise the webinar) arranged for a Chinese translation of the booklet.

You will find it on the <a href="http://xapi-cop.net/zh/2015/10/16/exploring-the-potential-of-the-xapi/" target="_blank">xAPI Chinese Community of Practice</a>
