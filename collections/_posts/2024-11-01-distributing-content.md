A question I've been asked often: How do I, a provider of elearning content, get my products to my business customers without losing control?

Here are your options:

1️⃣ Create a website that your customers will come to
2️⃣ Distribute content packages to your client for them to use in their LMS
3️⃣ Use a "proxy" service between your content and the client's LMS

Let's look at the pros and cons of each.

(And before anyone says use PENS, xAPI or LTI - yes, that would be great, but most organisations are not equipped to handle any of these, unless you're working in the education sector regarding LTI)

## Website

This could be a bespoke system, or something off-the-shelf like Learnworlds, TalentLMS or Moodle. The client, and their users, come to your website to access your content.

❇️ You control the user journey
❇️ You control access
❇️ You can measure anything you choose to measure
❇️ You're not limited to just what you can put in a SCORM package
❇️ The customer doesn't have to manage your content

⛔ Possibly complex data management issues to enable users to gain access
⛔ You may need to support your clients' single-sign-on systems
⛔ You'll need to find ways for your client's to access data about their learners
⛔ Your operation is tied to that website and its provider

## Distributed content packages

You create the products using an elearning authoring tool, and then send the SCORM packages to your clients to add to their LMS.

❇️ Low cost solution
❇️ The client handles all the user access aspects
❇️ Reporting is handled by the client's LMS
❇️ You can measure usage through the use of embedded, trackable files

⛔ You have no control over who is accessing the content
⛔ You're limited to whatever you can put in a SCORM package
⛔ You'll be sending large files for your clients to deal with
⛔ Version control will be a nightmare for you and your clients
⛔ You will have to troubleshoot your content inside the client's LMS

## Proxy service

In this case, you create the SCORM packages, and upload them to a service like Rustici's Content Controller or ScormProxy, or you create the packages with a tool that has proxying built-in, like Xyleme, Gomo or Dominknow Convey. The customer is sent a tiny "stub" package to add to their LMS. The proxy service controls who is allowed to see what content.

❇️ The customer just deals with small packages
❇️ The client handles all the user access aspects
❇️ Reporting is handled by the client's LMS
❇️ Version control will be easier to manage
❇️ You have full control over access to the content
❇️ Your clients are less likely to have compatibility issues

⛔ It's a (significant) extra cost
⛔ You're limited to whatever you can put in a SCORM package
⛔ If using a proxy linked to an authoring tool, you're then tied to that authoring tool
