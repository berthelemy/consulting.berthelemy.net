The goal of creating materials on the web is communication. The checklist below provides a test to see if your materials will communicate effectively.

##### Accessibility

- Have all your images got &lt;alt&gt; text - for use by people who rely on screen readers?
- Have you used h1, h2, h3 etc in an order that makes sense? So that people who rely on these to interpret the pages structure are not confused.
- If you've set text and background colours, do they have enough contrast?

#### Active voice

- Have you written your materials using an active voice throughout?<br>eg. “The board proposed the legislation” not “The regulation was proposed by the board.”

#### Building scent

- Do all your links to other pages contain enough information to let people know where they're going?<br>eg. "<u>More information</u>"&nbsp;not "Click <u>here</u>&nbsp;for more information".
- Have you underlined text that is not a link? That will be highly confusing for your audience.

#### Scannability

- Can your materials be quickly scanned? (Noting that people actually <b>read</b>&nbsp;very little - about 25% - of most web pages)
- Are they broken into small chunks?
- Do they have headings that are easily understood?
- Do they use bullet points rather than lists in paragraphs?

##### seful resources

#### Front loading

- Have you started with the material that's most important for your audience, with extra detail further down?

#### User language

- Are you using terms that your audience will understand?
- If your audience was searching for this material, what terms would they use?
