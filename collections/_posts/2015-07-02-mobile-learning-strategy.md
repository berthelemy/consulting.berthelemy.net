At this week&rsquo;s meeting of <a href="https://eastmidslt.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">East Midlands Learning Technologists</a> the focus for discussion was <strong>mobile learning</strong>.

#### Mobile &ndash; What is it good for?

With the introduction of ubiquitous, connected mobile devices into the workplace or the classroom, what can I do now that I couldn't do before?

+ Expect people to be able to access information at their point of need
+ Expect people to be able to communicate with peers and experts outside of fixed times or locations
+ Capture data (eg. audio and video) at any time

#### What needs to be in my mobile strategy?

As in most strategies, there are three components:

People &mdash; Processes &mdash; Technology

##### People

You will need to consider:

+ Current capabilities &ndash; of learning professionals and learners
+ Required capabilities &ndash; around study skills, digital literacy, learning design and content development
+ Organisational structures &ndash; such as online mentoring and content design and development
+ Training &amp; support
+ Change management &amp; communication

##### Processes

You will need to consider:

+ Your content development workflows &ndash; mobile adds a whole new dimension to this!
+ Your learner support processes
+ How you will retrieve data from mobile devices &ndash; to share in a classroom, or online

##### Technology

You will need to consider:

- Are you going to focus on online mobile delivery, using responsive web design?
- Will you use mobile apps? They are great for offline use, but can mean an extra layer of complexity
- Will you need to handle many types of device, or do you have control over the devices?
- Which tools will you use to develop and deliver content?
- Security &ndash; how will you handle sensitive data on devices you don't control?

#### Addendum

The recently released mLearning Design Reference Model from [ADL&rsquo;s MOTIF project](https://motifproject.org/) provides a useful [interactive Powerpoint](http://www.adlnet.gov/downloads/mlearning.pptx) (why Powerpoint rather than HTML, I&rsquo;m not quite sure). It helps learning designers and architects to focus on the unique characteristics of mobile devices and usage patterns.
