The endemic use of &ldquo;click here&rdquo; links within emails, web pages and elearning materials are an indication that many designers and authors need to learn to think more from the user&rsquo;s perspective.

Put simply, &ldquo;click here&rdquo; is bad practice. It is lazy and inconsiderate to your users.

Don&rsquo;t do it.

I have known for years that people tend to scan web-pages rather than read them (<a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/" target="_blank">Jakob Nielsen</a>). They are seeking signposts to further information: headings, short bullet points and links.

A link that just says &ldquo;click here&rdquo; tells you nothing about where it will take you. It&rsquo;s like a signpost in a street that says &ldquo;Walk down here&rdquo;. Meaningless.

Some people will try to mitigate this by providing some extra information after saying &ldquo;click here&rdquo;

Eg. *&ldquo;click here&rdquo;* to find out more about building widgets.

But that doesn't help the people who are:

- scanning for links
- using assistive software and tabbing through links (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php" target="_blank">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a>)

In both cases, that extra information is redundant as it won't be seen or heard.

#### What should I do?

The words you use for a text link are critical to help the user know whether they should click on it or not.

Like a trail of treats set out for a dog, your links should provide a &ldquo;scent&rdquo; of the next page. (<a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html" target="_blank">Krug: Don&rsquo;t make me think</a>)

In the example above, instead of saying:

> *&ldquo;click here&rdquo;* to find out more about building widgets.

Just use the link: *Find out more about building widgets*

It really is that simple. But it does need a tiny bit of extra thought about which words are going to convey most scent.

You may even find that more people then click on your links...
