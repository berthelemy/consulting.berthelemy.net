During last week&#8217;s Lean Learning Masterclass, I used the concept map below to explore how lean principles might apply to the design and delivery of learning interventions.

The map is designed as an aid to conversation, rather than as a self-study resource. However,Â wherever you see the button below in the live version, the map will provide links to additional resources for that particular topic.
