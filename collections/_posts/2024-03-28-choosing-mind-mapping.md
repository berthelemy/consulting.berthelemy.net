I've used mind-mapping as part of my consultant's toolkit for over 20 years. I find the technique particularly useful when gathering and sorting ideas in workshops, or when brainstorming for articles like this one.

At its simplest a mind map is a branching diagram, with each node on a branch containing an idea and its sub-ideas. You can do them on paper, but it's far better to use software. This allows you to move ideas around and make connections quickly.

A typical mind-mapping software tool will allow you to:

- Create hierarchical relationships - some even allow relationships from one branch to another
- Move nodes around easily
- Add notes, hyperlinks and attachments to nodes
- Customise the branches and nodes on the branches - with colours, shapes and icons (although look for software that does automatic colour coding)

            - Interactivity
: Some advanced mind mapping software offers interactive features such as drag-and-drop functionality, which allows users to rearrange nodes easily. Users can also add hyperlinks, attachments, and notes to nodes for additional context or reference.
            - Collaboration
: Many mind mapping applications support collaboration features, enabling multiple users to work on the same mind map simultaneously. Collaboration tools may include real-time editing, comments, and sharing options.
            - Export and Integration
: Users can export mind maps in various formats such as image files, PDFs, or text documents. Integration with other software tools such as productivity suites, project management platforms, and cloud storage services allows for seamless sharing and integration of mind maps into existing workflows.
            - Templates and Themes
: Mind mapping applications often provide pre-designed templates and themes to help users get started quickly and create visually appealing mind maps. These templates may cater to specific purposes such as project planning, brainstorming, or decision-making.
            - Search and Filter
: Advanced mind mapping software may include search and filter functionalities, allowing users to quickly locate specific nodes or information within large mind maps. This feature enhances usability and efficiency, especially in complex projects.
            - Presentation Mode
: Some mind mapping applications offer a presentation mode that allows users to present their mind maps in a slideshow format. Presentation mode typically supports features such as full-screen display, slide transitions, and presenter notes.
