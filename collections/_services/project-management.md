A project manager's role is primarily about people, supported by appropriate processes and technology.

As a waterfall project manager, I will plan, allocate resources, monitor progress and ensure the project remains within its alloted controls.

As an agile coach, I will help your team find and improve its best way of working, using either a Kanban or Scrum approach - depending on which is right for your project.
