    A structured way to assess the quality of your elearning materials
---


<p>A quality framework ensures that things are produced in a consistent way. The Elearning Quality Framework (EQF) provides a set of adaptable criteria to use as the basis of your organisation's or project's own quality framework.</p>

<p>I recommend that you include elements from each of the categories below within your own framework</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> This framework is designed for online materials used as a deliberate learning intervention. It would need adapting for performance support materials.</p>
