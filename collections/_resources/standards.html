<p>Industry standards serve two purposes:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Interoperability standards</strong> - allow multiple systems to work together without needing custom-built interfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality standards</strong> - set a bar against which to evaluate organisations and their processes.</li>
</ol>

<p>For inclusion in the list below, the standard must play some part in a learning technology ecosystem, such as the one illustrated.</p>
