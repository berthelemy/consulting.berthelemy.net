You've made your choice of technologies and now need to get them running in your organisation.

That will involve considering aspects such as:

- Hosting
- Configuration
- Data analytics
- Disaster recovery
- Integration with other systems
- Internal marketing
- Data migration
- Coordination
- Training
- Testing
- Support

Depending on the size of the project, you may have individuals or teams running each of these aspects. Or you may be reliant on one person for everything.

With Kerizac Consulting's experience across large and small scale projects, we can help you manage and coordinate the whole process, getting hands-on with the technology wherever necessary.
