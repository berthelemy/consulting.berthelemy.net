title: Oauth 2
subtitle: 
standard_id: Oauth 2.0
type: interoperability
last_updated: 2012
rationale: "To enable multiple systems to work together, it's best to have a centralised authorisation method - ie. single sign on"
purpose: "The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party
   application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on
   behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction
   between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the
   third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. "
