ISO 27001 is an international standard that provides a framework for an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

Its purpose is to help organizations systematically manage and protect their sensitive information assets.

It outlines requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an ISMS.

By adopting ISO 27001, businesses can identify, assess, and treat information security risks effectively.

Achieving certification demonstrates a commitment to robust security practices, building trust with stakeholders, aiding regulatory compliance, and enhancing an organization's overall cybersecurity posture.
