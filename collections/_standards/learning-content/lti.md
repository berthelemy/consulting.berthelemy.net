title: LTI
aka: Learning Tools Interoperability
standard_id: LTI 1.3
type: learning content
last_updated: 2019
purpose: "LTI provides a way for users of Learning Management Systems (LMS) or platforms to access remote tools and content."
strengths:
    - The provider system doesn't need to know about the user in advance
limitations:
    - Can make an awkward user experience if the consumer and provider systems' user interfaces are not well matched
    - The amount of data passed back to the provider system is quite limited
    - Each resource from a provider needs its own link setup within the consumer system

The LTI specification is mostly used within the education sector. It allows content providers to deliver their materials to institutional learning platforms without requiring any specific single-sign-on or user provisioning integrations.

It's rarely used in the corporate sector, unfortunately.
