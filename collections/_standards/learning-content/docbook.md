title: DocBook
aka: Shareable Content Object Reference Model 2004
standard_id: SCORM 2004
type: learning content
last_updated: 2006
status: ADL specification
route: formal
purpose: SCORM 2004 is an evolution of SCORM 1.2, enabling advanced elearning sequencing and detailed tracking.
strengths:
    - Advanced sequencing and navigation - enabling pre-requisites and adaptive pathways
    - Richer data model than SCORM 1.2 - allowing fine-grained reporting and analytics
    - Widely supported by both authoring tools and learning platforms
limitations:
    - Significantly more complex than SCORM 1.2
    - Primarily caters for a traditional linear course model
    - Aging technology which can lead to challenges with modern development practices and browser security
    - Relies on the user being online
    - Updating published SCORM packages can be difficult
rationale: "SCORM 2004 is the most up-to-date version of the SCORM family of specifications, used widely by learning management systems"
purpose: "Allows packages of content to be used in delivery systems, and detailed data about their usage tracked by the host system."

SCORM 2004 is an evolution of SCORM 1.2, offering more sophisticated tracking and sequencing capabilities. While SCORM 1.2 focuses on basic communication (completion, score), SCORM 2004 introduces richer data models and complex navigation rules.

Key differences include:

* Allowing course designers to dictate precise learning paths, prerequisite completion, and adaptive content delivery
* A more extensive data model for tracking learner interactions and progress - able to capture more granular information than the basic "completed" or "score" of SCORM 1.2.

Even though SCORM 2004 has been around for a while, it's rare to see implementations which take full advantage of the richer data model and learning pathways.
