aka: 
standard_id: cmi5
type: learning content
last_updated: 2016
purpose: "cmi5 bridges LMSs and xAPI content, ensuring reliable course launches and basic completion/score tracking while leveraging xAPI's ability to collect detailed data."
strengths:
    - Familiar methods - like SCORM
    - Robust launch mechanism
    - Provides rich data
    - More adaptable than SCORM for complex learning experiences
limitations:
    - Adds a layer of complexity to the content development process
    - Still requires detailed data design before creating the content
    - Focussed on "courses", rather than informal learning experiences
    - Requires a learning record store (LRS) to capture the data

cmi5 is an xAPI profile that addresses the need for a standardized way to launch and track online courses from a Learning Management System (LMS). Itcombines the strengths of SCORM with the flexibility of xAPI.

cmi5 acts as a bridge, telling an LMS *how* to launch an xAPI-enabled course and *what* basic data (like completion and score) must be sent back to the LMS.
