The Question and Test Interoperability (**QTI**) specification is a standard that allows for the exchange of digital assessments and their results between different learning systems. 

Its primary goal is to ensure that question items, assessments, and test results can be moved from one platform to another without needing to be rewritten or reformatted.

QTI defines a common structure for assessment content, including various item types (e.g., multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and essay), and a framework for delivering and scoring those items.

By adhering to the QTI standard, a quiz created in one system can be seamlessly imported and used in another.

It tends to be used more often in organisations that specialise in assessments.
