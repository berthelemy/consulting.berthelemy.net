I've created a quick &amp; dirty website with a sortable and searchable list of free tools. It's designed for trainers who need to get started with working online quickly.

> - Please don't expect the tools to solve all your problems. You will need to learn how to use them safely.
> - Look for tools that have a paid-for option as you grow. You'll want to know there's a solid business model behind anything you come to rely on.
