When I provide end-user support for people who are using Moodle, I use mental checklist when they come to me with problems.

### I can't login

1. If they've sent across their notification email, containing a username and password, then try to login using those credentials. If it works, then they must have typed either the username or password incorrectly. Check for stray punctuation marks at the beginning and end of the password.
2. Look for the user in Admin > Users > Browse list of users.
