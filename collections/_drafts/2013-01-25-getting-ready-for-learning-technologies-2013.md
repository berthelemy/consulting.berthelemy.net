I&#8217;ve learnt that exhibitions and conferences are far more useful when I use them for what they&#8217;re really good for: face-to-face conversations. Information I can get anytime, but real contact, with real-time interactive dialogue requires that face-to-face time.

If all you do is go to listen to presentations, or grab brochures off the stand, then you&#8217;ve wasted a lot of money and a lot of time. Focus on the conversations however, and you&#8217;ll find it a very worthwhile experience.

(That must be balanced with the pleasure of that serendipitous discovery of a product that you never knew existed but was exactly what you were looking for!!)

So, if you&#8217;re going to the <a href="http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/" target="_blank">Learning Technologies 2013</a> exhibition next week then here are some hints and tips on how to get the best out of the show.

## Listen in on the pre-conference chat

You&#8217;ll find many of the exhibitors, attendees and &#8220;official&#8221; social media facilitators will be posting to Twitter before, during and after the event. You can see the most recent posts in the feed on the right.

Don&#8217;t feel you have to read everything, just listen in during a coffee break or two. Get a feel for what&#8217;s being talked about. Check out a few links and perhaps even make some connections with people that might be interesting to talk to in person.

## Join one of the &#8220;eXchanges&#8221;

The <a href="http://www.towardsmaturity.org/article/2012/12/12/learning-technologies-exchanges-2013/" target="_blank">Towards Maturity/Training Journal eXchanges</a> pick up on the fact that conversation is a key part of the conference/exhibition experience. They provide a space for a small number of people to get together at a pre-arranged time, to talk about a particular topic. The conversations will be facilitated by one of the conference speakers and a chair-person.

You can <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/LTeXchange2013" target="_blank">register for a place</a> now (for free!), or take a chance and just turn up &#8211; space allowing.

There&#8217;s a wide range of subjects under discussion.

Highly recommended!

## Spend time talking to people

It sounds obvious, doesn&#8217;t it? But this took me a while to learn. Rather than just looking at what&#8217;s going on, talk to people about the things you&#8217;d like to do back in your workplace, about the problems you&#8217;re facing, about the constraints you&#8217;re under and about the things that you&#8217;ve found have worked.

You&#8217;ll find a lot of people in similar situations to you. And you&#8217;ll also find a lot of suppliers who really want to understand how they should develop and present their products &amp;services. Yes, they&#8217;re trying to sell, but suppliers know that they can only sell things that will really make a difference.

One key thing I&#8217;ve learnt is to always go to these sorts of events having arranged to meet up with key individuals. That puts some structure on the day, and ensures that I&#8217;m going to get some value from it.

## Have some questions ready for your target exhibitors

Hopefully, you&#8217;ve made a short list of suppliers you want to talk to. And also you&#8217;ll have researched their products and services beforehand so you won&#8217;t need to spend a lot of time understanding what they&#8217;re offering.

Once you&#8217;ve done that, you should have a list of specific questions to get answers to &#8211; and the sort of person you need to talk to &#8211; whether it&#8217;s a technical architect (ie. questions about hosting and integration), a solution specialist (ie. questions about how the product would work and be implemented in your situation), or a sales person (ie. questions about how pricing breakdowns and contracts).

Of course, don&#8217;t forget to hunt out suppliers you already work with. They love to see existing customers &#8211; even if they&#8217;ve got difficult questions. In some cases this may be the only opportunity you get to see people face-to-face.

## Follow up

Whatever you&#8217;re social networking tool of choice, use it to follow up the conversations you&#8217;ve been having at the event.

In particular, with Learning Technologies, get signed up for the <a href="http://learningandskillsgroup.ning.com/" target="_blank">Learning &amp;Skills Group</a>, &#8220;an international community of L&amp;D professionals interested in organisational learning and learning technology with 6,000 members.&#8221; This group is extremely well facilitated by the same team behind the Learning Technologies conference, and operates webinars and other online activity throughout the year.
