Today&#8217;s meeting of the East Midlands Learning Technologists focussed on &#8220;[Flipped Learning][1]&#8220;.

The group mainly comprises people working within the Further and Higher Education sectors, both as consultants and as full-time support staff.

We began with a handful of Pecha Kucha presentations (short, 5 minute show &amp; tells):

## Scaling the Digital Landscape: Elaine Swift

A <a href="http://www.ntu.ac.uk/adq/teaching/scale_up/index.html" target="_blank">project</a> which looked at the digital literacy skills required for a flipped learning approach.

  * Rooms are designed to promote collaboration
  * Content is encountered outside class and sessions devoted to applying ideas
  * Problem-solving tasks done in class in collaborative groups

Macbooks were chosen as the main technology (to take advantage of in-class Apple TV sharing), but the learning curve was found to be very large for students, who were mainly used to Windows. [I wonder whether a [Chromebook][2] with Chromecast approach might be more effective?]

The project found an improvement in students&#8217; confidence in using the digital tools.

## How I used &#8220;flipped learning&#8221; before it was invented: <a href="http://www.a6training.co.uk/" target="_blank">Dave Ford</a>

14 years ago, Dave taught a PE course on paralympic sports. The sports hall was great for practical, but wasn&#8217;t conducive to the theory elements of the course.

With a larger than ideal group, Dave split the group into two smaller groups, which allowed an approach whereby students were given tasks to do before doing the practical element. These pre-tasks often required the creation of materials (eg. a session plan), which was enforced strongly. Without the pre-work, the rest of the course was meaningless.

The time that was now available in the sports hall was quality time. And, rather than being at the front, Dave&#8217;s role in those sessions was to have deeper conversations with the students.

The key learning point was that flipped learning requires a complete rethink in how you design both materials and the classroom sessions. You can&#8217;t just provide a Powerpoint that you used in the classroom and expect it to work as a self-study resource.

## Flipping Midwives: Kirstie Coolin

<a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/helm/home.aspx" target="_blank">Health Elearning and Media Team</a> &#8211; part of the School of Health Sciences at the University of Nottingham

Main drivers for change in teaching &amp; learning:

  * Student attrition
  * Francis Report

The aim is to &#8220;flip&#8221; midwifery teaching to 50% elearning and 50% face-to-face time:

  * Make the most of the face-to-face time
  * Enable critical analysis &amp; deeper learning
  * Student-centred and personalised
  * Challenges of time &amp; space
  * A dedicated team means it&#8217;s feasible

Move from web-supported -> web-integrated.

Used the <a href="http://wiki.ulster.ac.uk/display/VPR/Home" target="_blank">Viewpoints cards from University of Ulster</a> to support the curriculum redesign on cross-disciplinary workshops.

Planning the activities starts with the face-to-face session; build everything else out from there.

The sign-posting for students is critical. To ensure students know what to do when.
