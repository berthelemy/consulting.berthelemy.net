Everyone else seems to be making their predictions for the coming year, so we thought we&#8217;d better jump on that particular bandwagon with our own thoughts &#8211; focussed on the field of learning technologies.

## Digital by default

Just as the UK government is pushing all government services to a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default" target="_blank">Digital by Default</a> position, we wonder whether this will start to be seen across all education, training and learning sectors.

For many people, it&#8217;s already reality. They can get all the learning they need via online resources and social networks. Between them, Google, Twitter, Youtube and Wikipedia probably account for a vast amount of the developed world&#8217;s learning activity.

If schools, colleges, universities and workplace L&amp;D departments choose to run with this policy, face-to-face interactions in the same location will become the exception rather than the norm. When there is a classroom session, or a meeting, it will be called because that&#8217;s the **only** way to achieve a particular objective.

## Cross-fertilisation between academia and corporate

Wyver Solutions has already been involved in collaborations between academic institutions and corporate learning specialists. We are expecting and hoping to see many more of these.

Of course, it&#8217;s possible that future collaborations may simply take the form of compliance training delivered via lecture capture systems&#8230; But our hope is that we&#8217;ll end up with the best parts of both sectors &#8211; delivering high-quality online, scenario-based content combined with active facilitation and deep thinking.

## Open source authoring

With <a href="http://www.xerte.org.uk/" target="_blank">Xerte</a> making strides into becoming a well-governed and mature open-source project, and <a href="https://community.adaptlearning.org/" target="_blank">Adapt</a> launching its first release in 2014, the stage is set for open-source authoring tools to start to become mainstream.

Xerte already has a very large userbase, primarily in Higher Education. Given its focus on producing highly <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/Overview.html" target="_blank">accessible</a> content and its suitability for producing lots of content very quickly, we can see it beginning to be used on particularly in large public sector programmes.

Adapt has the backing of some major companies in the corporate elearning sector, and already has some impressive demonstration materials. As a means of creating tablet-ready learning materials, with complex interactions, it&#8217;s going to take some beating.

The exciting thing is that both Xerte and Adapt use an open data-structure to describe the learning materials that they then produce. With a little tweaking it will become possible for both systems to read and write each others&#8217; data.

## Learning Technologies 2014

We&#8217;ll be at the <a href="http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/" target="_blank">Learning Technologies</a> exhibition in January. So, if you want to challenge, debate or question anything we&#8217;ve said, <a title="Contact us" href="http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/cms/contact-us/" target="_blank">get in touch</a> to arrange a time and place.
