</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  How many of them do you think would consider the following?
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  &#8216;Talking head&#8217; style videos are great for storytelling and providing &#8216;background&#8217; context.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Audio interviews can be useful for conducting interviews with key stakeholders or Subject Matter Experts or for achieving the &#8216;talking head&#8217; outcomes above but for the camera-shy!
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Screencasts &#8211; talk to your IT Helpdesk and identify what their top 5 enquiries are in relation to. Consider producing short screencasts to minimise the number of calls the IT team receive &#8211; they&#8217;ll thank you for it!
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  QR codes (included on internal posters, flyers, welcome letters etc linking to any of the above resources to add personal context) &#8211; Traditional print media is useful, but there&#8217;s only so much information you can place onto it and there always the danger of it becoming out of date. A QR code will allow you to incorporate a range of media and using a tool such as <a href="http://delivr.com/">delivr.com</a> will even allow you to change the QR codes destination without changing the poster/flyer/letter etc
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Survey tools such as SurveyMonkey can be used in a variety of ways including the use of response logic to create branching assessments.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Interactive PDF documents are a great way of providing FAQ documents and checklists. Checklists are an incredibly powerful, yet under-utilised tool. What better way of providing workflow support than in a checklists format. For anybody who wants to find out more about the power of them we strongly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/1846683149">The Checklist Manifesto</a>.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Animations are very easy to create using products such as <a href="http://www.powtoon.com/">Powtoon</a> and <a href="http://www.sparkol.com/">Sparkol</a>. These cheap (often free) tools can be used to produce short-form animations to tell a story, outline a process or provide additional context to any of your learning activities or corporate communications.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Online classrooms can be used to deliver content, as part of a blended solution, or even as &#8216;drop in&#8217; clinics to allow Subject Matter Experts to keep in touch with people around various subjects.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  All of this and not a next button in sight!
