We&#8217;ve been spending quite a bit of time recently with <a href="http://www.efrontlearning.net/" target="_blank">eFront</a>. It comes from the team at Epignosis who have also brought us <a href="http://www.talentlms.com/" target="_blank">TalentLMS</a> (a fantastically user-friendly, cloud-based basic learning management system).

eFront is the older brother of TalentLMS, and is designed to support a more tutor-led, social approach to online learning.

Four key, stand-out features are:

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">A really clean user interface, which draws a lot on modern techniques like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" target="_blank">AJAX</a></span>
  * A Facebook-like chat box, that sits at the bottom of your screen 
  * A search engine that really works. All the content you create across the site (except for SCORM packages of course!) is searchable &#8211; subject to your permissions to see it.
  * The ability to make comments against every piece of content or test 
    
  These days we would tend to look at eFront as a first port of call before <a href="http://moodle.org" target="_blank">Moodle</a> &#8211; primarily down to its usability.
            
  It doesn&#8217;t do all the face-to-face event management and     administration that <a href="http://www.enterprisestudy.com/" target="_blank">Enterprise Study</a> (a Wyver Solutions <a title="Partners" href="http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/cms/about/partners/" target="_blank">partner</a>) is good for, but for straightforward, content-based online learning eFront is hard to beat.
            
  If you can&#8217;t get what you need out of the Community Edition, which is released as an Open-Source product, you can upgrade to the commercial Education or Enterprise editions. Neither of which are particularly expensive.
