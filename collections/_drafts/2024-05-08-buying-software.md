This guide is designed for those who buy software for organisations.

Not for procurement experts, but instead those who are just trying to make things work better for their teams.

If you **are** a procurement expert, then welcome! You might find that I've simplified some things a fair bit, or even left things out that you consider important. Please [let me know](/contact) and I'll make some changes.

For smaller projects, if you're the only person involved, you might be able to merge some of these steps together. For example, steps 1-5

## Step 1: Identify the problem

You probably have a rough idea of what you're trying to achieve, or the problem you're trying to solve. But it's worth spending a short time writing this down. You'll need it when you engage with suppliers.

Make sure you can answer these questions:

- What are you trying to improve? Generally software can be helpful to increase efficiency, to reduce risk or to maintain consistent quality. Which of these apply to your situation?
- How big is the problem? What will happen if nothing changes? Will you lose money? Will you be fined? Will your competitors do things better, faster or to higher quality for the same price?
- What are you measuring that indicates the size of the problem? You might want to consider metrics of time, quantity, complaints or incidents. The exact measurements will depend very much on your industry and particular context.
- What would you like to achieve in terms of those performance metrics?

## Step 2: Identify possible solutions

You've probably already started doing this. You'll have seen marketing materials, or stands at conferences, or maybe you've been cold-called by a product representative.

But let's take a small step back.

Consider these questions to help in your thinking and your future conversations with potential suppliers:

- What have you tried so far? Do you have a cobbled-together solution built on Excel or something similar?
- What has worked? What doesn't work? What characteristics would you like to keep from the existing solutions?
- What have you learnt in the process? What needs to improve from your current solution? Perhaps consider things like robustness, reliability, multiple users with multiple roles, version control etc... These will depend very much on your context.
- What are your competitors or partners doing in this space? How are they solving similar problems?
- What does your current "landscape" look like? In terms of other software, your IT infrastructure, current regulations and standards, your culture, your finances, and your organisation's existing capabilities. What will your new solution need to fit into?
- What **types** of solutions seem to fit your problem? Is there a specific genre of off-the-shelf software that you're looking for? Can you filter that genre into sub-groups. For example: You might want a system to help manage learning experiences, but you're working for a training company. That immediately narrows the field.
- What is your vision for the future? Consider changes that may be happening in society, technology, your organisation, your customers etc.   
- How agile can you be? Are you able to manage change well? Do you want something that works out-of-the-box? Or do you need something that is highly configurable or even bespoke? Or do you want software you can customise?
- Do you want an all-in-one solution, or a combination of different best-of-breed providers? Do you have the skills to join them together?

## Step 3: Make a long list

Now you have an idea of the sort of thing you're looking for. So you can start looking for potential suppliers.

Where to look:

- **Search engine adverts**: Type in the name of one, major supplier and you'll be given adverts for a whole host of competitors
- **Search engine generic search**: Type in the genre of software you're looking for. Don't forget to also include <mark>"open source"</mark> if you're looking for free or customizable software. They don't have the marketing budget to compete with the commercial vendors.
- **Comparison sites**: Places like [G2](https://www.g2.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Alternative To](https://alternativeto.net/){:target="_blank"} can be useful starting points
- **Analysts**: Different industries have their own specialist analysts. For learning technology, you could look at [Fosway's 9 grids](https://www.fosway.com/9-grid-2/){:target="_blank"} or [Craig Weiss' Find An LMS](https://www.findanlms.com/){:target="_blank"}
- **Blog posts**: If you're looking for something with mass appeal (like project management software), you'll find dozen of blog posts comparing different systems. Look at the comparison factors that they identify. Be warned, many are written by suppliers trying to make their software sound the best...

Start to identify the key differences between the suppliers. It's like looking for a house - you'll gradually start to pick out the things that are important to you.

Consider:

- Features - does it do what you think you're looking for?
- Pricing models - are they even available? If not, then are you big enough for that supplier to deal with?
- Support & training - can you see any documentation? Is there free training available online to give you a feel for what's on offer?
- Usability - can you get a feel for how easy the software is to use?
- Accessibility - do the suppliers even mention this?

## Step 4: Create user scenarios

As part of your selection process, you'll need to test out the software. Scenarios will help ensure a fair test across multiple products. They'll also help the suppliers to quickly assess whether their software will meet your needs.

The scenarios should describe the experience you expect for your users. Pick 3 or 4 key areas that you want to test out. Try to pick some that are key to your particular context and needs.

Consider the following:

### Users and organisations

- Who will be the key user groups? Eg. End user, Client administrator, Client managers, Site Administrator. You might want to do a scenario for each type of user.
- Are all the users going to be from one organisation? If not, will you need to keep the data for each organisation separate?
- Will you need to break down the users into further sub-groups? For what reasons?

### User onboarding

- How will your users be brought into the system?
- How will they receive their login details?
- Will you be connecting into one or more Identity Providers (like Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc)?
- Will users self-register?
- Will users pay for their own access? How?
- Will users pay on behalf of other users? How?

### Access control

- Will some users have access to some parts of the system, whilst other users have access to other parts?
- Who will need to see data about users from the organisation(s)?

### User tasks

- What will prompt users to login? How will they receive that prompt?
- Once a user is logged in, what do you expect them to be able to see and do?
- How they will know what they need to do?
- How will they see what theyâ€™ve done?
- Will their journeys be linear (following a standard path)?
- Will users be able to choose their route? How will they be guided?
- Will all users follow the same route?

### Reports

- What reports do you need to be able to see?
- What reports do your users need to be able to see?

Now turn all that into a set of short narratives.

## Step 5: List the requirements

Now that you've examined what software is available, and have developed your scenarios, you can come up with your list of requirements. Try to be as specific and descriptive as possible. A list of features on its own can be pretty meaningless. They gain more meaning when you say how you expect the feature to work for you.

You might want to separate your requirements using these categories:

### Non-functional requirements

#### Performance

- What is the maximum expected response time (eg. pages should load within 3 seconds on a 4g connection)
- How many concurrent* users the application support? (eg. support at least 2,000 concurrent users)

*concurrent = the number of people actively using the system at the same time

#### Scalability

- How will the application respond to unforeseen peak demands? (Give examples of what might happen to cause these)

#### Availability

- What is your expected minimum uptime percentage (eg. 99.99% availability)
- How quickly do you need to recover the system should something fail? (Recovery Time Objective)
- How much data can you afford to lose should the system fail? (Recovery Point Objective)
- What mean time between failures do you expect?

#### Security

- How will the application keep your data private?
- How frequently should the application be tested for vulnerabilities?
- How will the supplier and its suppliers (eg. data centres) keep your data private?
- What are you data encryption expectations - at rest and in transit?
- Do you require compliance with standards like PCI-DSS, ISO 27001 or Cyber Essentials

#### Usability

- Do you require a responsive interface for both end users and administrators?
- What level of accessibility standards do you expect?
- Do you require the application to work in multiple languages? Which?
- Do you need the application to be able to handle content that you enter in multiple languages?

## Maintainability

- Requirements for updates, extensions, configurability
- Coding standards and technical debt limits

## Portability
- Support for multiple hardware/software platforms
- Backward and forward compatibility[1][3]

Other common non-functional categories include recoverability, robustness, environmental factors, regulatory compliance, and more. These requirements ensure the system meets expectations for quality attributes beyond just functionality.[2][4]

Non-functional requirements. Functional requirements. Integration requirements. Reporting requirements. Prioritisation.

Be prepared to change these during the process. This is the first pass.

MoSCoW prioritisation.

You can give each item a weighting - if you want to be really mathematical about this.

## Step 6: Make the short list

How will you whittle it down?

Solutions that meet all the Must haves, most of the Should haves, some of the Could haves.

## Step 7: Competitive dialogue

Write down the process. Key dates. Your needs. Initial set of requirements. The scenarios.

Process:

The more important this software is, the more iterations you should do.

-- Initial conversation
-- Slim down the list
-- Model the scenarios 
-- Present the models  (is it just sales, or do they have a solutions architect?)
-- Slim down the list
-- Refine the requirements (send out RFP)
-- Deep dive
-- Due diligence
-- Provide pricing
-- Final proposal
-- Last two
-- Negotiations
