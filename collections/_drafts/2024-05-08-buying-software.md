This guide is designed for those who buy software for organisations.

Not for procurement experts, but instead those who are just trying to make things work better for their teams.

If you **are** a procurement expert, then welcome! You might find that I've simplified some things a fair bit, or even left things out that you consider important. Please [let me know](/contact) and I'll make some changes.

Some of the steps below may not be relevant to your particular situation, but I'll make clear when you might be able to take some short cuts for simpler projects.

## Step 1: Identify the problem

You probably have a rough idea of what you're trying to achieve, or the problem you're trying to solve. But it's worth spending a short time writing this down. You'll need it when you engage with suppliers.

Make sure you can answer these questions:

- What are you trying to improve? Generally software can be helpful to increase efficiency, to reduce risk or to maintain consistent quality. Which of these apply to your situation?
- How big is the problem? What will happen if nothing changes? Will you lose money? Will you be fined? Will your competitors do things better, faster or to higher quality for the same price?
- What are you measuring that indicates the size of the problem? You might want to consider metrics of time, quantity, complaints or incidents. The exact measurements will depend very much on your industry and particular context.
- What would you like to achieve in terms of those performance metrics?

## Step 2: Identify possible solutions

You've probably already started doing this. You'll have seen marketing materials, or stands at conferences, or maybe you've been cold-called by a product representative.

But let's take a small step back.

Consider these questions to help in your thinking and your future conversations with potential suppliers:

- What have you tried so far? Do you have a cobbled-together solution built on Excel or something similar?
- What has worked? What doesn't work? What characteristics would you like to keep from the existing solutions?
- What have you learnt in the process? What needs to improve from your current solution? Perhaps consider things like robustness, reliability, multiple users with multiple roles, version control etc... These will depend very much on your context.
- What are your competitors or partners doing in this space? How are they solving similar problems?
- What does your current "landscape" look like? In terms of other software, your IT infrastructure, current regulations and standards, your culture, your finances, and your organisation's existing capabilities. What will your new solution need to fit into?
- What **types** of solutions seem to fit your problem? Is there a specific genre of off-the-shelf software that you're looking for? Can you filter that genre into sub-groups. For example: You might want a system to help manage learning experiences, but you're working for a training company. That immediately narrows the field.
- What is your vision for the future? Consider society, technology, your organisation, your customers etc.   
- How agile can you be? Are you able to manage change well? Do you want something that works out-of-the-box? Or do you need something that is highly configurable or even bespoke? Or do you want software you can customise with your own code?

## Step 3: Make a long list

Look at what's on offer. Where to start? G2, Capterra, Analysts. Think wider than standard solutions. Consider whether you need an all-in-one solution, or best of breed. Look at what the suppliers are offering in terms of features, pricing models, support and training, scalability, usability, accessibility. Look at reviews. What do they look for?

If they don't provide pricing, then they're looking at an enterprise deal. Are you big enough?

Don't just ask for a list on LinkedIn.

## Step 4: Create user scenarios

Who will be the key user groups? What do they need to be able to do? How often will they want to do it? List the key tasks. Now write at least three scenarios that you will use to test the software. Tell the story that you want to see happen.

## Step 5: List the requirements

Non-functional requirements. Functional requirements. Integration requirements. Reporting requirements. Prioritisation.

Be prepared to change these during the process. This is the first pass.

MoSCoW prioritisation.

You can give each item a weighting - if you want to be really mathematical about this.

Define your evaluation criteria & matrix

## Step 6: Make the short list

How will you whittle it down?

Solutions that meet all the Must haves, most of the Should haves, some of the Could haves.

## Step 7: Competitive dialogue

Write down the process. Key dates. Your needs. Initial set of requirements. The scenarios.

Process:

The more important this software is, the more iterations you should do.

-- Initial conversation
-- Slim down the list
-- Model the scenarios 
-- Present the models  (is it just sales, or do they have a solutions architect?)
-- Slim down the list
-- Refine the requirements (send out RFP)
-- Deep dive
-- Due diligence
-- Provide pricing
-- Final proposal
-- Last two
-- Negotiations
