We&#8217;re really pleased to announce that Wyver Solutions now has an ongoing partnership with [Enterprise Study][1] &#8211; the leading player in the market for cloud-based training administration systems.

Enterprise Study are a UK company who create software to help organisations manage the formal component of their training provision, including classroom learning, virtual classroom learning, video-based learning, assessment, compliance, supplier management, commercial courses, appraisal and coaching.

Their software can be quickly deployed (as it’s a multi-tenanted solution hosted “in the cloud”), and is very straightforward to configure and use.

We consider Enterprise Study to be the leading player in this market. They are highly innovative and focussed on the user.

Wyver Solutions offers implementation support for Enterprise Study as part of our wider package of [consultation services][2].
