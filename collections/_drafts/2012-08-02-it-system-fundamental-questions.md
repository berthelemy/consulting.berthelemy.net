  1. Single or multi-user?
  2. Internal or external hosting?
  3. Multi-function or best of breed?

This post explores these questions; outlining the advantages and disadvantages of each option. There are no right answers, but as you consider them, don&#8217;t just think about your requirements now. Think about how you will grow into the system.

### Single or multi-user?

<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">
    </th>
    
    <th width="40%">
      Advantages
    </th>
    
    <th>
      Disadvantages
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Single-user
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Low cost
        </li>
        <li>
          Simple to install
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Difficult to work collaboratively
        </li>
        <li>
          Difficult to share data
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Multi-user
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Collaborative working made more easy
        </li>
        <li>
          Data can be shared and aggregated
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Higher cost
        </li>
        <li>
          More complex to deploy
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Internal or external hosting?

<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">
    </th>
    
    <th width="40%">
      Advantages
    </th>
    
    <th>
      Disadvantages
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Internally hosted
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          May be lower cost if equipment and people are already in place
        </li>
        <li>
          You retain total control of your data
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Often more expensive &#8211; especially with teams who do not understand the software being deployed
        </li>
        <li>
          You are responsible for maintaining the hosting platform, its security and disaster recovery
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Externally hosted
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Total cost of ownership may be lower &#8211; especially if the supplier already has experience with the software being deployed
        </li>
        <li>
          Economies of scale with Software As A Service products means that platform maintenance, security and disaster recovery are likely to be first class (but check first!!)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You lose control of your data and its security &#8211; make sure you can get it out if you need to, or if the company goes bust
        </li>
        <li>
          You are reliant on the quality of your internet connection
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Multi-function or best-of-breed?

<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">
    </th>
    
    <th width="40%">
      Advantages

    <th>
      Disadvantages
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Multi-function
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The component parts are likely to be well integrated, in terms of single-sign-on and data use
        </li>
        <li>
          Only one interface for people to learn
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          May be less capable than a combination of best-of-breed tools
        </li>
        <li>
          You may end up paying for elements that you do not use
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Best-of-breed
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You pay for the parts you use
        </li>
        <li>
          You will get an overall &#8220;best-of-breed&#8221; system
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Integrating multiple different systems may prove problematic and costly
        </li>
        <li>
          Multiple interfaces may make it harder for users to get started
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
