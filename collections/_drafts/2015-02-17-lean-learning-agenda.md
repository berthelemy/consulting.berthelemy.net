The <a href="https://leanlearningmasterclass.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">Lean Learning masterclass</a> with Sean Buckland is nearly upon us. You have just over 1 day if you want to book up!

We&#8217;re really looking forward to it. This post is designed to help attendees get the most out of the day.

It contains a small amount of pre-work, which will help to give some context.

We&#8217;ve also outlined the agenda for the day. We do expect this to be flexible within the overall time constraints, so that we can ensure we meet the actual needs of the people there.

## Pre-work

The “Lean” approach is first and foremost a mindset.  To help frame your own learning questions for the event, here’s a selection of links to brief videos that might help. Please try to watch at least one.

  1. Summary of the historical perspective (yet still so relevant): early 1900s to early 1990s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHvnIm9UEoQ&amp;index=1&amp;list=PL98D93E7C8E4047DC" target="_blank">Deming parts 1, 2  and 3</a>: (3 x 10 mins)
  2. Creating structure around a Lean transformation approach: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEcdliWZH30" target="_blank">The Lean Enterprise Institute’s transformation model summarised</a> (10 mins)
  3. A taster of some of the simple things that can be done that can have a surprisingly large effect on team and organisational performance &#8211; &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3BoLRVXoI0" target="_blank">How to build a Kanban board</a>&#8221; (please note, although called Kanban, it’s not! See comment below video) (4.5 mins)
  4. (Shown below) A well-made promotional video for a consulting firm that makes it look oh-so-simple, but does show the importance of a structured process of improvement starting with the customer (although tailored to manufacturing environment) &#8211; &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfsRAZUnonI" target="_blank">Four principles of lean management</a>&#8221; (2 mins)
  5. And finally, but perhaps most relevantly… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcdahNIu820" target="_blank">how do we change thinking?</a>  This video is both relevant to yourselves and your learners/customers:  (4 mins)

Hopefully you will find the time to watch these videos.  They are very varied, yet all talk about the same thing: how to improve the way *any* work works.

Please use these to help frame a set of 1-3 questions that you would like insights into as a result of attending this event, and then [contact us][1] with your questions by Tuesday 24th February** **so that we can help shape the content around your objectives.

## Masterclass Agenda

### 09:30 Introductions and Objectives

### 10:00 Section 1 – The Lean Context

We will explore some or all of the ideas below, along with a break at about 10:45

  * What is and isn&#8217;t lean?
  * What has lean got to do with learning and development?
  * The concept of value from a learning perpective
  * Defining the purpose(s) of a learning and development service
  * What would the perfect service look like from a (fully aware) customer&#8217;s perspective?
  * What are the things that are common to L&amp;Dservices that are, on reflection, waste?

### 11:45 Section 2 – Learning and development processes review

(including lunch at 12:30)

In order to eliminate waste in learning &amp; development, what has Lean to say on:

  * Training Needs Analysis
  * L&amp;Dservice processes
  * Design
  * Delivery
  * Qualifications
  * Evaluation

### 14:00 Section 3 – Useful Lean approaches to learn and use

(including a break at 14:45)

The turnaround doesn&#8217;t happen overnight, nor in one single step&#8230; We will explore a number of practical first steps

### 16:30 Wrap – review and action planning

An important time to identify and prioritise what you will do in the next 7 days.
