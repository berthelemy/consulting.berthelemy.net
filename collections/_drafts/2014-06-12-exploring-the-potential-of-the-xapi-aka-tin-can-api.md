If we, the global learning community, choose to adopt the Experience API, we will be able to release learning content and activities from the confines of the Learning Management System, and track both their usage and their real-life impact.

The effects of this will be highly disruptive to the entireÂ learning technology marketplace.

This white paper explores that potential, and how the various stakeholders will benefit from adopting the xAPI.

It will:

  1. Consider the benefits of the Experience API over existing technologies
  2. Explore some of the issues that you might need to face when implementing the Experience API
  3. Illustrate how to get started with the Experience API
