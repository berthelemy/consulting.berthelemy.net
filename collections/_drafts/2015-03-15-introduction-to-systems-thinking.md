As part of our work on Lean Learning, we&#8217;ve also been looking at the whole concept of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking" target="_blank">systems thinking</a>&#8221; &#8211; where, rather than focussing on a specific component, you look at how the component fits within the wider system.
