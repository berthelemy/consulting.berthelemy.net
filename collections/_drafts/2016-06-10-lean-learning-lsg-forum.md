At next week's gathering of the Learning &amp; Skills Group, we will be leading a highly conversational workshop looking at how "lean" might apply within the Learning &amp; Development context.

Picking up on ideas coming from the manufacturing and service delivery sectors, our discussion will consider the five lean principles:

- Identify the value provided to customers
- Map the value stream & remove waste steps
- Maximise flow
- Establish pull
- Iterate towards perfection

We'll do some exercises, share ideas and experiences and leave with some immediate things we can try out.

To support the workshop, we've developed a <a href="http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/leanlearning">Lean Learning</a> resource page containing links and further information.

We're looking forward to meeting many of you next week!
