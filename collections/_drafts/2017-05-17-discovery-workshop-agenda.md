You've sold your product or service into a client. They've trusted you enough to get you in to look at what they need, and are paying you to work through a process to help them understand their next steps.

Normally, what I'd do in this situation is to run a face-to-face discovery workshop - led by your solutions architect or consultant.

This has a three-fold aim:

1. To build excellent relationships across both teams
2. To end up with a shared understanding of what is to be achieved
3. To develop a shared understanding of how that will be achieved

Sometimes a workshop like this will just last a day, but often it's longer. Much depends on the complexity of the project. But the critical thing is it must be face-to-face. Whilst it's tempting to do this virtually, you will find that this causes major problems further down the line, as you just won't have the quality of relationship needed to solve problems together.

So here's how I run things - remembering that this is a generic agenda, and is likely to need adapting for specific circumstances.

There are all sorts of ways to run through this agenda. My approach is to try to make it as interactive as possible, using group work exercises to get people talking and thinking.

All the Discovery outputs should be created, written up and agreed during the Discovery workshop. This saves time in the long run, as everyone is engaged and committed to the outputs.

What you then have is a set of work packages (agile: epics or user stories), which can be estimated (Agile) or costed (Waterfall) in order to move on to the next stage of the project.

If you need help to run your next Discovery workshop - either as a client or a supplier please <a href="/contact.html">get in touch</a>.
