On 4th April, the <a href="http://www.elearningnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Elearning Network</a> are hosting an <a href="http://www.elearningnetwork.org/events/lms-and-tin-can" target="_blank">event about Learning Management Systems and Tin Can</a>.

To be honest, the Tin Can bit is the biggest component &#8211; because learning data is far more than just about the LMS. It&#8217;s about what content people are looking at on the intranet, what they&#8217;re searching for, what they&#8217;re asking on the corporate social network, what online meetings they&#8217;ve attended, and how well they&#8217;re performing in their jobs.

We&#8217;ve got some great speakers booked. People who can get right to the heart of what Tin Can (also known, much less interestingly, as Experience API) is about.

You&#8217;ll be able to ask them the pithy questions about what Tin Can might mean to you and your organisation.

When you come to the event, bring a can or two of food. For two reasons:

  1. It&#8217;ll be a way of recognising other Tin Canners on the tube&#8230; <img src="http://wordpress-wyver-temp.localhost:8888/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  2. We&#8217;ll be donating all the tin cans to the All Souls lunch club for vulnerable elderly people

The event is kindly sponsored by our friends at <a href="http://www.unicorntraining.com/" target="_blank">Unicorn Training</a>.
