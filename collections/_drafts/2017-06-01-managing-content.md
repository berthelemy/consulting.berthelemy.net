Whether you're a training organisation, with multiple clients, or a large organisation with diverse training needs, you're likely to be creating a lot of documents and other content.

This post outlines a number of techniques that you can use to keep that content under control.

## Debt for the future

In many organisations, each time you create a new document, powerpoint or elearning resource, you massively increase the size of your future problems.

Think ahead to when you need to:

- Change your organisation's logo or colours
- Change any boilerplate text like disclaimers





version control, reviews, lifecycle, reuse
