As well as our long-standing relationship with [Emmanuel International UK][2], we have added the [Boaz Trust][1]Â to our set of regularly supported charities.

The Boaz Trust is a Christian organisation serving destitute asylum seekers in Greater Manchester.

They provide accommodation, as well as food and other essentials, to those who are unable to access support from anywhere else.

They also provide advocacy and pastoral support, and campaign on a local and national level for justice in asylum legislation.

For more information, see our page on &#8220;[Supported Charities][3]&#8220;, where you will also find recent updates from the charities we work with.
