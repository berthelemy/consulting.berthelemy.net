Back in 2020, I wrote an article called "[Is your elearning broken](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-elearning-broken-mark-berthelemy/)." In it I put forward the idea that SCORM packages hidden away inside an LMS are not really useful to the end-user.

I still stand by that opinion, but would go a step further. I'm wondering whether traditional elearning (the aforementioned SCORM packages) are an evolutionary dead-end in the world of learning and development?

Outside of corporate Learning & Development and military training, the idea of creating packages of HTML content and stuffing them inside a learning management system just doesn't exist.

The rest of the world relies on a host of other methods to teach, train and learn online. So why are we stuck with SCORM?

## Brief introduction to SCORM

But first, let's take a very quick look at SCORM, what it is, and why organisations adopted it.

SCORM (Shareable Content Object Reference Model) is a specification for how content is packaged, how it's described and how it communicates with a host learning platform. It was initially designed for the US military in the days when each base's learning platform was sitting locally, and they wanted a way to distribute the same piece of content to multiple bases.

The idea was picked up by a nascent elearning content development industry as a means of creating and distributing content to multiple clients, each of which had their own learning platform.

Since then, we've had a massive growth in authoring tools and platforms all designed to feed this industry.

But do we need SCORM these days?

What does it offer?

- A way to package up mini-websites (typically), with no restriction on what goes in those packages
- A way to describe those websites, with metadata that very few people use, and most authoring tools don't support
- A way for data to pass from the learning platform to the mini-website and back, allowing administrators to track what users have done

## Why packages?

That's the question. Do we need packages of web content at all? Yes, we see packages of other types in a learning context: videos, podcasts, documents. But what about HTML?

Mostly, out on the web, HTML content is served up by content management systems. Rather than each package of content containing all the branding required, this is added to the content by the system at the point of delivery.

You could have a single piece of content branded in different ways for different audiences, but delivered by the same system.

So no, we don't really need content packages at all. Except maybe the most complex simulations, which may be best delivered in the same way as online games, using standards-based frameworks like [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), [Defold](https://defold.com/) or [Impact](https://impactjs.com/) - using the content management system to serve them up to whoever needs them.

## What about tracking what people are doing?

I'd argue that, in many cases, tracking is unnecessary. It measures nothing except inputs, when, really, we should be tracking outputs.
