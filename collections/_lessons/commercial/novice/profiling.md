## Challenge

You're putting together a budget for project that will run over the course of the year. Show how your spending will change over the course of the year. If you don't have a project in mind, then go with this one:

> Your project is to design and deliver powerpoint training for a large, nationally dispersed organisation.

## Acceptance criteria

Use a spreadsheet with the following layout. I've prepopulated with some typical high-level project phases:

| Cost item | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1: Discovery |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Item A  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Item B  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Phase 2: Design |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Phase 3: Delivery |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| **Total costs** | **£--** | **£--** | **£--** | **£--** | **£--** | **£--** | **£--** | **£--** | **£--** | **£--** | **£--** | **£--** |

Set the currency of the estimates to match your local currency.

## Resources

A **fixed cost** is one that will not change regardless of any other variables (such as the number of people, or the size of the files to be stored).
