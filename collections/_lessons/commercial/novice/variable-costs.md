### Challenge

Estimate the variable costs associated with delivering a new service. If you don't have a service in mind, then go with this one:

> Your organisation is proposing to provide online and face-to-face training for a large, public-sector organisation. 

### Acceptance criteria

Use a spreadsheet with the following layout:

| Cost item | Estimated amount per unit | Number of units | Type of unit | Total cost
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Item A  | £--  |   |   |   |
| Item B  | £--  |   |   |   |
| **Total variable costs** |   |   | **£--** |

A unit is the thing that will vary.

Set the currency of the estimates to match your local currency.

### Resources

A **variable cost** is one that will change as the number of the things delivered goes up or down.
