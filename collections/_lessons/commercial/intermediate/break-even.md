### Challenge

Given the cost of developing a new product (in the [[ Project Budget ]](project-budget) lesson), develop a pricing and marketing model that would enable you to break even within 1 year.

### Acceptance criteria

You must state your assumptions about the numbers of product units sold.

### Reflection

- Are your assumptions reasonable?
- Do you need to return to your product budget to enable you to break even within one year?
