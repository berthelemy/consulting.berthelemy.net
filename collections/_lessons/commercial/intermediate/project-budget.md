### Challenge

Estimate the fixed costs associated with delivering a new service. If you don't have a service in mind, then go with this one:

> Your organisation is proposing to provide online and face-to-face training for a large, public-sector organisation. 

### Acceptance criteria

Use a spreadsheet with the following layout:

| Cost item | Estimated amount |
|---|---|
| Item A  | £--  |
| Item B  | £--  |
| **Total fixed costs** | **£--** |

Set the currency of the estimates to match your local currency.

### Resources

A **fixed cost** is one that will not change regardless of any other variables (such as the number of people, or the size of the files to be stored).
