<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or complete a contact form on https://mark.berthelemy.net (the “Site”).</p>

<h3>Personal information I collect</h3>

<p>When you visit the Site, I automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, I collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. I refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</p>

<p>I collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</li>
    <li>“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</li>
    <li>“Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally when you complete my contact form, I collect your name, email address and phone number in order to return your message.</p>

<p>When I talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, I are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.</p>

<h3>How do I use your personal information?</h3>

<p>I use your contact information to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>communicate with you</li>
  <li>when in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to additional products or services.</li>
</ul>

<p>I use the Device Information that I collect to help me screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize my Site (for example, by generating analytics about how my customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of my marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>

<h3>Sharing your personal information</h3>

<p>I share your Personal Information with third parties to help me use your Personal Information, as described above.  For example, I use Zoho to manage sales and support queries. <a href="https://www.zoho.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">View Zoho's privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p>I also use Google Analytics to help me understand how my customers use the Site. You can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here:  <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information I receive, or to otherwise protect my rights.</p>

<h3>Do not track</h3>
<p>Please note that I do not alter my Site’s data collection and use practices when I see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.</p>


<h3>Your rights</h3>
<p>If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information I hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact me through the contact information below.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are a European resident I note that I are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts I might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Site), or otherwise to pursue my legitimate business interests listed above.  Additionally, please note that your information may be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.</p>

<h3>Data retention</h3>
<p>When you communicate with us, I will maintain your Personal Information for my records unless and until you ask me to delete this information.</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>I may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to my practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>
