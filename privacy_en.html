<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or complete a contact form on https://mark.berthelemy.net (the “Site”).</p>

<h3>Personal information we collect</h3>

<p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</p>

<p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</li>
